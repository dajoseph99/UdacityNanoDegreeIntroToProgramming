<p><b>Basic HTML Tags</b></p>
<p>Tell a web browser how to display something on a web page.</p>
<p>Some HTML tags have opening and a closing tags.</p>
<p>Some are void, meaning its just a instruction to the web browser, there is no content, the is not a closing tag</p>
<p><b>Bold</b> Tags make text <b> Bold </b></p>
<p><em>Italic</em> Tags make text <em>Italic</em></p>
<br>
<p><b>HTML Attributes</b></p>
<p>HTML tags can have attributes that are used for creatng links to other documents</p>
<p>For example, my favorite site is <a href="http://www.udacity.com">udacity</a> use the URL of udacity as an attribute used by the hyper link</p>
<p>Imiages can be displayed using attributes pointing to the source location:</p>
  <img src="http://www.udacity.com/cs253x/hipmunk.png" alt="Link to Chipmunk Drawing" height="42" width="42">
<p>If the image cannot be displayed, then the alt attribute "text" is shown.</p>
<p>Some tags are inline and others are block. According to <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_blocks.asp">w3schools:</a></p>
<p>Inline tags: An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.</p>
<p>Block tags: A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).</p>
